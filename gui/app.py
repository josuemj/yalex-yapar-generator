# Combined UI with Yalex and Yapar

'''
This file implements the graphical user interface for the YALex/YAPar Generator project.

The UI will:
- Allow users to input YALex specifications for lexical analysis
- Allow users to input YAPar specifications for syntax analysis
- Generate visual representations of automata
- Provide functionality to test input strings against the generated analyzers
- Show results of the analysis process, including parse trees and error reports
- Allow for exporting generated code and analysis results

TODO:
- Implement file upload/download functionality
- Create tabs for different sections (lexer, parser, testing)
- Add visualization components for automata and parse trees
- Connect UI to the YALex and YAPar backend modules
- Implement error handling and display
